#Contributing

owllib is very much an early alpha, and will always welcome new additions.  To contribute, please fork and submit a pull-request.  I'm doing this in my off time, but I shouldn't take too long to either merge in your changes or provide some feedback on what additional changes might be needed.

#Examples

Coming later (and possibly soon!)
